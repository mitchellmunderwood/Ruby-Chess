# get each piece a class
#   create classes for every piece specifically
#   make sure the methods and calls and state all line up

#
# build a board
#   change the board class to populate using the new piece classes
#   be sure to require all the needed pieces
#   change the positions of pawns so that spaces are available for moves
#   render the board
